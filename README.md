# pokedex

  Gotta catch'em all

dependence 

 - `pip install google_images_download`
 -	`pip install pygame`
 
 # project idea
 the project idea is make a pokedex app to desktop with pokemon's dynamic images (in other words imagens dowload and delete), pokemon ' s elements and powers.
 for that i think use pygame window and a dataset with names.
